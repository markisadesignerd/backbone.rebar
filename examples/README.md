# Examples Setup (Locally)

There are a number of examples within this git repository that you can use to see the available features of the library. Any example directory with a server.js JavaScript file within it is one that can be run as a local node server. You'll need to have node and npm installed on your computer to run these servers. Once you have these two dependencies you can run the following commands to start the examples:

	$ cd /examples
	$ npm install
	$ node server

After the server has been started you'll be notified with a port number. You can then open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:PORT. By default, port number is set to 8889 in `examples\server.js` on Line 12.
